            8/25/23 - In class, we created our websites and began to learn the basics of HTML. We learned how to change text (write new text, italicize, bold, change color, instert images, etc.) We were also introduced to the engineering process and safety guidelines.

            9/11/23 - In class, we began learning how to CAD and we created a cup on TinkerCad. We had a challenge where we created a kitchen appliance and voted for whose was the best. We began drafting ideas for our Rube Goldberg machines and chose which design our group was going to go with. We then created the design as a CAD and began to make the pieces out of cardboard. After we were done outlining the pieces with pencil, we began to cut them out of the cardboard.
